Overview

This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed to extract text information from images. The system utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze images, recognize characters, and convert them into machine-readable text.
Features

    Image preprocessing: The system employs various preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and noise reduction to enhance OCR accuracy.
    OCR Engine: The core OCR engine is powered by Tesseract, a widely-used open-source OCR engine.
    Language Support: The project supports multiple languages, and additional language models can be easily integrated.
    User-friendly Interface: A simple command-line interface allows users to easily run OCR on single or multiple images.
